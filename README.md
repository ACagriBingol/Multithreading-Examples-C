# Multithreading-Examples-C

This repository contains examples of multithreading and concurrent programming in C using the Pthreads library.

To use these examples, you will need to have the Pthreads library installed on your system. If you are using Linux, Pthreads is likely already installed. If you are using Windows, you can download the Pthreads library for Windows from the pthreads-win32 website.

To build and run the examples, you can use a C compiler such as GCC or Clang. Each example is contained in a separate source file and can be compiled and run using the following commands:

gcc -pthread example.c -o example
./example
