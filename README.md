# Multithreading-Examples-C

This repository contains examples of multithreading and concurrent programming in C using the Pthreads library.

To use these examples, you will need to have the Pthreads library installed on your system. If you are using Linux, Pthreads is likely already installed. If you are using Windows, you can download the Pthreads library for Windows from the pthreads-win32 website.
